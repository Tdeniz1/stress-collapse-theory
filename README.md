# Fainting to Survive: An Evolutionary Hypothesis of Vasovagal Syncope as a Social Signal

## Abstract
Vasovagal syncope, more commonly known as the fainting reflex, is typically viewed as a maladaptive quirk of the nervous system. This paper proposes a novel evolutionary hypothesis: that fainting evolved in early humans as a selected social signal to enhance survival. We define vasovagal syncope and outline its physiological mechanism of abrupt bradycardia and hypotension leading to transient loss of consciousness. We then present the hypothesis that ‚Äúplaying dead‚Äù via fainting served as an adaptive communication, mimicking death or severe incapacitation to both deter further aggression and solicit help from nearby group members.
